"""Known-debt gate for ``_audit_codebase.py`` + PR-Δ verification gate
for ``_audit_pr_delta_metrics.py``.

Two semantics, two baselines, two evaluators:

- :data:`CODEBASE_DEBT_LIMITS` + :func:`evaluate_debt` — debt counters
  (one-direction drift; improvement OK with INFO, regression FAIL).
- :data:`STRICT_EQUALITY_BASELINE` + :data:`BASELINE_RATCHET_UP` +
  :data:`BASELINE_RATCHET_DOWN` + :func:`evaluate_pr_delta_metrics` —
  ADR-0038 PR-Δ counters. Three layers stacked:

    1. **Strict equality** (all PR-Δ keys): current actual == current
       baseline. Both directions FAIL.

    2. **Baseline movement ratchet** (subset of keys): current baseline
       vs base baseline. UP-keys (tests, carriers) baseline can only
       grow; DOWN-keys (exempted) baseline can only shrink. Catches
       "baseline silently dropped to match silently-removed actual"
       collusion — strict equality alone doesn't.

    3. **Removed-key防绕** (all PR-Δ keys): keys present in base
       baseline must remain present in current baseline. Prevents
       "rename ``backend_pytest_count`` to ``backend_pytest_count_v2``
       and claim bootstrap" loophole. Key migration requires a
       dedicated migration PR, not a smuggle inside a cut-over PR.

  **Bootstrap exception** is the ONLY way a key skips ratchet: ``key
  not in base_baseline``. No flags, no env vars, no PR labels — purely
  data-shape-driven, self-extinguishing the moment the key lands in
  main's baseline.

  Base baseline source priority:
  - ``GITHUB_BASE_REF`` env var (set by the CI runner on PR events)
    via ``git show <base_ref>:<path>`` — the immutable PR base SHA,
    not a moving target.
  - ``origin/main`` fallback for local dev / non-PR runs.

  In PR CI (``GITHUB_BASE_REF`` set) failing to read base FAILs the
  audit. Local dev (no PR context) skips ratchet with INFO. This
  asymmetry is intentional: CI must never silently downgrade to
  "strict equality only".

Scope boundaries (don't let this mechanism bloat into a怪物)
-----------------------------------------------------------

This gate is targeted defense for high-risk surfaces. It is NOT a
universal quality gate. Three hard boundaries:

**1. Engagement is data-driven, not policy-imposed.**
   The gate only "engages" when the audit's counter actuals drift from
   baseline. README / UI text / color-only / non-routing bugfix PRs
   don't touch the receiving code → actuals don't move → no baseline
   bump required → audit passes silently. No path filter is configured
   in CI; the strict-equality semantics自然只在受管 surface 改动时才
   产生声明义务。

**2. Adding a new counter requires answering five questions in the PR
   that introduces it; failing any question = don't add the counter:**

   - Is it stable (won't drift with environment / time)?
   - Is it machine-verifiable (grep / collect-only / AST exact count)?
   - Does it defend against a real risk (not "seems useful")?
   - Can it be easily gamed (and if so, what守护 makes it un-gameable)?
   - Does it have a clear owner?

   Reviewer rejects a counter-addition PR if these aren't answered.
   This is the dam against "audit-creep" — every "let's also count X"
   gets the questions, most don't survive them.

**3. Numeric counters defend against silent regression, NOT prove
   quality.**

   ``backend_pytest_count`` / ``android_junit_test_method_count`` exist
   to catch "tests silently deleted in a refactor PR". They are NOT
   measures of test quality — count rising doesn't mean coverage rose.
   Quality measures are a different axis (critical-path tests, mutation
   tests, contract tests, route security matrix, tenant isolation
   cases, migration rollback, real E2E), and would be enforced by
   different mechanisms if/when added. Confusing the two leads to
   people writing trivial tests to make a number go up — defeats both
   purposes. The PR-Δ gate stays in its lane.

    2. **Baseline movement ratchet** — for ``BASELINE_RATCHET_UP`` keys,
       current baseline must be ``>=`` base baseline; for
       ``BASELINE_RATCHET_DOWN`` keys, ``<=``. Catches the
       "baseline silently dropped to match silently-removed actual"
       collusion that strict equality alone misses.

    3. **Removed-key防绕** — keys present in base baseline must remain
       in current baseline. Prevents renaming a key
       (``backend_pytest_count`` → ``backend_pytest_count_v2``) to
       claim bootstrap exemption.

    Bootstrap exception: a key not present in base baseline skips ONLY
    the ratchet check (layer 2). Strict equality (layer 1) still
    applies. This is purely data-driven — the moment a key lands in
    main's baseline, bootstrap自动失效 for that key. No flags, no
    overrides.

    Composed of helper functions to stay under the C901 complexity gate;
    each helper owns one concern (compute strict layer / compute ratchet
    layer / print strict failures / print ratchet failures / print info /
    print final OK line).
